  keys = {
    { "<leader>CC", "<cmd>Codock<cr>", desc = "Toggle Codock", mode = { "n", "v" } },
    { "<leader>CP", ":'<,'>CodockFilePos<cr>", desc = "Copy file path and line info", mode = { "n", "v" } },
    { "<leader>CA", ":'<,'>CodockActions<cr>", desc = "Run Codock actions", mode = { "n", "v" } },
  },
}
```

## 2. Usage

After installation, you can run the following commands:

### 2.1 Codock Command

Run the `:Codock` command to open a terminal in a vertical split running the configured AI CLI command.

### 2.2 CodockFilePos Command

The `:CodockFilePos` command copies the relative file path and line/column information to the clipboard in various visual modes, then send it to the AI CLI tool.
